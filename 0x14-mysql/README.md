## 0x14. MySQL  

### Tasks:  

0. Install MySQLMySQL installed on both your web-01 and web-02 servers.  

1. Let us in!  
- to verify that your servers are properly configured, we need you to create a user and password for both MySQL databases which will allow the checker access to them.  

2. If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
- set up replication, youâ€™ll need to have a database with at least one table and one row in your primary MySQL server (web-01) to replicate from.  

3. Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?  
- Before you get started with your primary-replica synchronization, you need one more thing in place. On your primary MySQL server (web-01), create a new user for the replica server.  

4. Setup a Primary-Replica infrastructure using MySQL  
- Having a replica member on for your MySQL database has 2 advantages:  
	+ Redundancy: If you lose one of the database servers, you will still have another working one and a copy of your data  
	+ Load distribution: You can split the read operations between the 2 servers, reducing the load on the primary member and improving query response speed  

5. MySQL backup  
- Bash script that generates a MySQL dump and creates a compressed archive out of it.  
- Requirements:  
+ The MySQL dump must contain all your MySQL databases  
+ The MySQL dump must be named backup.sql  
+ The MySQL dump file has to be compressed to a tar.gz archive  
+ This archive must have the following name format: day-month-year.tar.gz  
+ The user to connect to the MySQL database must be root  
+ The Bash script accepts one argument that is the password used to connect to the MySQL database
